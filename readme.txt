For full-flavoured API support, you'll need to be using pretty permalinks to use the plugin, as it uses custom rewrite rules to power the API.

1) Upload the files to the /wp-content/plugins/wptoandroid/ directory or install through WordPress directly.

2) Activate the "Wordpress to Android" plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
